# Introduction

My name is Eric Schwabe. I work as a software engineer, currently on commericial aerospace test systems. 

I am always looking to expand my interests and expertise, so I decided to try writing a blog.

Fascinated with personal computers and electronic devices  growing up. Grew up as the Internet became common in every household. 

Committing to a time investment
The Beginning
Starting something new is always a challenge. Getting over the hurdle of actually sitting down and accomplishing your goal is difficult.

# Why A Blog

A place to keep track of my thoughts and things I've learned. Information is difficult to organize. Google does a decent job, but it's not a collection of only my interests or recent work. 

Give it a shot. 

Why do I want to write a blog?
Many other blogs out there. Don't expect a lot of readers, but I am mainly writing it for myself. It's easy to lose track of your "progress" over time. So many things to learn. Something to reference in the future. Improve my writing speed.

So, what is the purpose?
Gather my thoughts and ideas related to my pursuit of knowledge. I plan to primarily focus on software engineering and programming related topics, but I may diverge on occasion.
